jspro

I love typescript.

I love webpack.

I love procon.

I like atcoder.

`yarn watch` or `npm run watch` to watch.

`yarn build` or `npm run watch` to build.

`node dist/[name].js` to run. name would be a (relative path from back/contests).replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/^_|\.ts$/g, '')
(e.g. node dist/atcoder_abc120_c.js)
