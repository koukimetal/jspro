jspro

I love typescript, webpack and procon.

I like atcoder.

`yarn watch` or `npm run watch` to watch.

`yarn build` or `npm run watch` to build.

`node dist/<relative path to the file from back/contests >.js` 

`Ctrl + D` would work as EOF

`watch` uses development build which enables you to debug. On vscode, you should be able to debug easily.

`build` uses production build. It helps you submit short code.
